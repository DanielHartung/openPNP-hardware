# Rooibos - OpenPnP Hardware

Rooibos is my take on a PnP machine based around the OpenPnP project. My goal with this machine is to make a machine that can be made by poeple without access to any CNC equipment.
### Feeder
The feeder is a drag tape type feeder that holds the component reel.
* Print has been tested and it holds the reel and components in place
* Prints at 0.2mm in 45 minutes on Ultimaker (92 minutes on i3)
* not tested yet on machine
